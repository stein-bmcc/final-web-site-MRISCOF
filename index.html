<h2>Here I present you my highlights of the semester</h2>
<p>We started with the right foot, and went directly with audio module with "AUDACITY", pesonally I found it to be very entertaining. The freedom to do what I thought was the best for my project was very inspiring; not mentioning the time I spent on it. Then we moved to images, which was another hit, I cannot say I consider myself an "ILLUSTRATOR" fan, but I can say it for "PHOTOSHOP", again my favorite part was do something that identifies you was genious. Quickly we moved to animation, and I did struggle a little bit for the animation, but i would be lying if I say I did not have fun, combinating "PHOTOSHOP", and "AFTER EFFECTS". Lastly for the big price we started a website with "GITHUB", something that combinates creativity and modern technology, this has been, a gret journey so far.</p>
