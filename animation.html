<p>This is the final product of my work in Animation in MMP100, I have to admit it was very interesting, fun, and many other positive adjetives you could find. The only negative thing I could say is the time consuming it migth be depending on what you are trying to achieve, but at the end, when you see the product, it brings a very pleasant feeling.</p>

<p>This is the Background I created, my idea for the animation is having a charactern arriving to earth, but having many different ideas came across, and finally I decided to make it land to the moon.</p>

<p>This is the main character, I used one of my favorite characters of a TV show as an influence for this character, but made major changes so it would not be a copy paste on it.</p>
